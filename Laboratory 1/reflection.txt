The Reynolds and NNGroup principles are the ones I found most useful. They served as great guides on how to create a better-looking presentation from scratch,
as opposed to before, where I would just create ones at the top of my head, which was considerably harder than it should be. Having learned these principles has made it much
easier to create presentations, as I now have some form of mental framework to properly design a presentation based on the topic.
