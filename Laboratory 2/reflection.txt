Creating the self branding kit has definitely opened my eyes for creativity in such ways that
I can define myself using not just words but also colors and design. Creating the logo was the most 
difficult part for me, I have had many iterations for what I should make it look like; how to create
something small to somewhat define who I am. And after plenty of reasearch as to how to create a logo,
I have somehow settled with the simples one possible. This is not because I got lazy or did not want
something complicated. I settled with it because it reflects how much I've always appreciated the simplest things.
