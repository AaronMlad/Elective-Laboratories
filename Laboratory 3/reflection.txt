After creating these graphics, I've definitely gained some experience in creating posts and graphics that attract attention to you.
To achieve these results, I used the same elements, color palette, and fonts from the previous laboratory, and I think things turned out great.
With these created, I have also started to love and embrace the design options I made to make things as visually appealing as possible without creating too much noise.
I might start using these exact same elements, font, and color palette for my future projects that are unrelated to school.
